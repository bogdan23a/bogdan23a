I'm Bogdan Gherasim, a programmer for the beautiful yet occasionally baffling land of Romania. I spend my days wrangling code and crafting software that (hopefully) doesn't explode.

Right now I'm focusing on contracting work - think of me as a mercenary for hire, but instead of swords and shields, I wield keyboards and caffeine. The goal? To fund my grand plan to eventually diving into the world of open source, where I can contribute to making the internet (and possibly the world) a slightly less chaotic place. 

I'm always on the lookout for interesting projects, so if you have something in mind, don't hesitate to reach out.

What I do:
* write code that sometimes works on the first try (but not always)
* tackle software challenges with the enthusiasm of a Labrador chasing a tennis ball
* dream about the day I can focus solely on open source without worrying about pesky things like paying the bills 

I will leave you with a quote from a Romanian fairy tale, I find this is the embodiment of those tiny infuriating bugs that pop up right before a deadline. Just like this passage, a programmer's life is a battle of wits against chaos, where steaks are high, and the margins for error are thinner than a semicolon.

> As he (Greuceanu) was lazily moving forward, reclining in the cart, he passed by a lame devil who was blocking travelers' paths to cause them trouble. This devil was afraid to confront Greuceanu directly, but so as not to let him escape untouched by his devilish mischief, he removed the nail from the rear axle and threw it far behind.

> Greuceanu, jumping out of the cart, accidentally forgot his sword there. And while he was looking for the nail, the devil stole his sword. Then, sitting by the side of the road, he turned over three times and transformed into a stone statue.
